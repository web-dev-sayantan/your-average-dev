Look, I get it. Some people prefer light mode. Maybe you work in a sun-drenched office with floor-to-ceiling windows. Maybe you're a vampire who's trying to blend in. Maybe you just hate your eyes.

Here's a quick code example that looks better in dark mode (obviously):

```typescript
function shouldUseDarkMode(): boolean {
  const hasEyes = true;
  const caresAboutThem = true;

  return hasEyes && caresAboutThem;
}
```

## But Fine, I'll Support It

What else can I do, I'm pro choice. I respect bad choices.

## Conclusion

So yes, I still support light mode. But every time you toggle that switch to "light," somewhere a developer sheds a tear.

Also you're wasting electricity, burning out the oled panel faster and your eyes don't like you anymore.
